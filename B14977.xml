            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the tiding which the Poſt of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> brought here of the Treatie which is now in France apppointed; there were here diuers ſpeeches, rumours, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures ſpread abroad of the deſignes of the King of <hi>France;</hi> and the order which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy giuen before to ſome Colonels to march towards <hi>Alſatia,</hi> was alſo againe renued by the Imperiall Councell. And the Colonell <hi>Schauwenberg</hi> who lay with his Regiment at <hi>Eger</hi> vpon the Frontiers of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> marcht preſently with it towards <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and there were alſo yet two other Regiments, and ſome horſe appointed to follow him with all ſpeed they could make.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> hauing conferred at <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg,</hi> with the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:177443:3"/>they ſent the Emperour word of the reſolution by them taken; namely, that they deſired that a meeting might be appointed, at which the Electors might one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare for to treat about ſome particular points concerning themſelues, as to prouide that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour might not any more hereafter diſpoſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Lands of any Elector, without the conſent of the vvhole Colledge: And to conſult alſo, and to conclude, who ſhall haue right to ſucceede the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> after his deceaſe in the Electorate, intending to exclude the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> and his iſſue for euer.</p>
               <p>The Generall meeting which was appointed in <hi>Morauia</hi> is now ended, and the States of the Land haue agreed to pay within the ſpace of ſixe moneths 250000 Florins (each of them is worth three ſhillings Sterling) vpon condition that they of the Countrie ſhall haue an abſolute pardon, and bee diſcharged of the Souldiers vvhich are in it.</p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> hath againe made an inuaſion vpon our frontiers, there are neuertheleſſe yet many that thinke the Great Seigneur will breake the Peace betwixt the Emperour and him.</p>
               <p>The Coſſacks haue not as yet receiued the money which is promiſed vnto them for a part of their pay, and are therefore continuing their exceſſes and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>

               <p>It continueth ſtill, that the Turkes hauing made themſelues very ſtrong about <hi>Offen,</hi> inuaded <hi>Lowentz,</hi> and did there great hurt both by fire and ſword. There is now great doubt made of the Peace betwixt The Emperor and the Great Seigneur: for <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> ſent hither an Ambaſſador with a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the name of the Great Seigneur to him <hi>(Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Gabor)</hi> by which he deſired to know whether, if occaſion ſhould be offered, hee would take part with him, or the Emperor. Whereupon <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> deſireth to know of the Emperor how and in what manner he may aſſure his owne Eſtate, and in what faſhion he will protect him, what ayd, and how ſoone he will bee ready to ſend it vnto him: and proteſted moreouer, that in caſe of deniall of ſuch ayd as is required, the Emperor ſhould haue no reaſon to blame him, if to preſerue his lands and ſubiects he turned to the other ſide.</p>
               <p>The Tartars haue done great hurt in <hi>Polen,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated many Polonians: and the King of <hi>Polen</hi> hath ſent for the Coſſackes which are in theſe lands, but they will not depart before they be payd. Whereby it appeareth, that it is not true that (as ſome repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the Polonians ſhould haue defeated the Tartars which made the late inuaſion in <hi>Polonia.</hi>

               <p>The diſmiſſing of the Coſſacks is not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for want of money, as by reaſon of the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent troubles in the Empire, and the other neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lands.

               <p>And it is here rumored, that if the Peace bee once broken with <hi>France,</hi> that 8000 or 10000 Coſſacks ſhall bee ſent thitherwards to waſte and ſpoile the Country.</p>

               <p>On Wedneſday laſt were at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> yet ſome new Patents or Commiſſions granted to leauie ſome 1000 men of which 1000 are to be Burgonions, and the reſt Wallons and Flemmings, or other Low-Country-men.</p>
               <p>They of the Caſtle of <hi>Gennep</hi> hold ſtill out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues very brauely and valiantly.</p>
               <p>The laſt Letters which came out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> haue againe confirmed the taking of the Bay called <hi>Todos Los Santos,</hi> which maketh the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to ſay that all the Saints are become <hi>Geus</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

               <p>The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (as they ſay here) hath armed at <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſome 25 Galeons, &amp; other ſhips, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſend them with ſome thouſands of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to recouer the Bay againe. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> will be ready for them, in ſending another Fleeet to ſuccour the firſt. But there are many which hold that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhall hardly at this inſtant bee able to get either Mariners or ſouldiers enough to make ſuch an enterprize.</p>
               <p>Two men of Warre chaſed lately a <hi>Dunkercker</hi> and draue him vpon the ſands by <hi>Blanckenberg</hi> not farre from <hi>Oſtend,</hi> tooke ſeuen or eight of the men, and the reſt ſaued thmſelues a ſhoare, and fired the ſhip thereupon.</p>
